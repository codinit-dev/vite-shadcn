Make every design beautiful, unique, and not cookie-cutter.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Webpages should be fully featured, responsive, and production-ready.

Use TSX, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React hooks, and Lucide React icons by default.

Don’t add extra UI libraries or icon packs unless I ask for them or they’re absolutely necessary.

Icons and logos should come from Lucide React.

Aim for clean, modern, and polished results every time.

DO NOT REMOVE ANYTHING FROM THE PACKAGE.JSON ONLY ADD TO IT
